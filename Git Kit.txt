<-- Initial stsge -->

--> first create a repo in github, 

--> if repo is new and there is no files in that repo,

--> create a empty folder in your local system, then open the terminal in your local system

--> now follow the steps mentioned

    Add files in that folder you created then apply neccessary changes if you want, then in your cmd or terminal

1) git init

2) git add .

3) git commit -m "Your message"

4) git push origin master 
        By default git consists master as main branch if you want you can change the name from master to "your suggested name"


<-- Pull commands  using http-->
Normally this will help full when you are doing projects with collabration 

--> Here also same but 1st you need to clone the repo 

        At the very first stage

1) git clone url
 
    Modify the changes

2) git init

3) git add .

4) git commit -m "Your message"

5) git push origin master 
            or 
   git push origin branch_name

If the repo is upated with some files then you can simply pull the repo

    git pull origin master
